			<h3>Visual Communication and Design (VCD)</h3>
			<p>I'm a student at Eastern Washington University studying Visual Communication Design. Initially I wanted to go into accounting, then business, and after trying a few classes in VCD I realized that's what I want to do. Art was a part of my life since I was a kid, I liked to draw and make sketches. Now studying VCD as my major and business for minor degree. EWU provides great opportunities for those who wants to become a graphic designer. The more I work on design projects the more I realize this is what I would like to do for my career.</p>

I do photogarphy and cinematography and having design skills will be a great addition to my professional skills.</p>
