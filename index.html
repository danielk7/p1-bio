			<h3>Visual Communication and Design (VCD)</h3>
			<p>I'm a student at Eastern Washington University studying Visual Communication Design. Initially I wanted to go into accounting, then business, and after trying a few classes in VCD I realized that's what I want to do. Art was a part of my life since I was a kid, I liked to draw and make sketches. Now studying VCD as my major and business for minor degree. EWU provides great opportunities for those who wants to become a graphic designer. The more I work on design projects the more I realize this is what I would like to do for my career.</p>

			<h3>Professional Objectives</h3>
			<p>Studing at Eastern Washington University expended my knowlege by taking different classes, including typography, visual communication classes, drawing, and web design. Web design is something that I never thought I would do and was staying away from it, but taking those classes made realize it's a great opportunity to go out into World Wide Web and make my design visible. I do photogarphy and cinematography and having design skills will be a great addition to my professional skills.</p>
